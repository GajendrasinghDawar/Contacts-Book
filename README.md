# App from Tutorial of React Router v6

This project is Remix of  Tutorial of React Router v6.4 . Check [https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) ).

I have also integrated  `Django` for Backend APIs.
Its now full stack App.

The Tutorial is so helpful. If You are novice to client side routing and, need quick guide on client side routing.
